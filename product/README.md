## Core Concept

A metagame oracle for competitive MTG players. Scrapes tournament results, synthesizes with LLM, tells you what's winning and why. Primary audience: RCQ grinders. Secondary: ladder climbers.

The moat is the synthesis layer — MTGGoldfish shows numbers, this app explains what they mean.
